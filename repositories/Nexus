Nexus is a product of Sonatype.
There are many nexus tools (nexus repository, nexus container, nexus firewall)
store - jar,war, container image, helm charts,reports, logs zip, tar, linux pkg, rpm pkg.......
default port 8081
nexus has prod(release) and non-prod(snapshot) repos.

*Proxy repos -from ogr. system some repos are not directly accissible so they provide proxy repos. which cache the response(if not presnt) then talk to main/central repo.
* Group repo - it can contain multiple repo(Hosted(ogr. private data), proxy(help to connect to public repos)) and have single URL so can access both.
             - it can have multiple hosted repo(Diffrent teams) but will have same URL so CI server can talk to all repos.

Nexus give by default maven release/snapshot hosted repos.
- release needs to have diffrent version 1.0. 1.1....
- snapshot doesnt req. to have diffrent version nexus append timestamp.

* Replication - replicator helps
- u can replicate a repo from diffrent nexus srever to ur nexus server
- can have bi-derctional replication also

* Can have user, and can be accessed by ananonymus use but they have only read.
- can give access to particular repos only.
